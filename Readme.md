# Marp presentation bootstrap gaia theme
Marp (also known as the Markdown Presentation Ecosystem) provides an intuitive experience for creating beautiful slide decks. You only have to focus on writing your story in a Markdown document.

# Create the presentation
- Modify the Presentation.md
- Add local image (not recommended) in `./images/`. They will be copied as assets at the time of the build
- run the NPM scripts:
  - `watch`: build the html file taking into account the modifications made in the md file.
  - `build`: build the presentation in html, pdf and pptx in the publish folder.
